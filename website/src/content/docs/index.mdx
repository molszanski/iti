</CardGrid>

## Features

- **supports async(!) dependencies:** merges async code and constructor injection via plain **async** functions
- **strongly typed:** has great IDE autocomplete and compile time check. Without any manual type casting
- **non-invasive:** does not require imported `@decorators` or framework `extends` in your application business logic
- **lazy:** initializes your app modules and containers on demand
- **split chunks:** enables **dynamic imports** via a one liner thanks to a fully async core
- **React friendly:** has useful **React** bindings to help you separate application business logic and a React view layer
- **starter friendly:** works with starters like Create React App or Next.js unlike existing libraries
- **no Babel config:** doesn't require `reflect-metadata` or decorators so there is no need to hack in decorator and `"decoratorMetadata"` support in to your build configs
- **tiny:** less than 1kB
